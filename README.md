## **📊 Dataset**
The chatbot uses a curated dataset of medical queries, prescription formats, and symptom-related responses. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and noise addition are used to enhance handwritten text recognition.

## **🌟 How It Works**
Users interact with the chatbot through a simple text-based interface.
The chatbot processes the query using pre-trained models like MedAlpaca or BioMedLM.
It retrieves relevant information from prescription data and contextualizes the response.
Interaction history is stored for future reference, ensuring personalized assistance.
